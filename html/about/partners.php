			<p class="card-text">VATSIM, or Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network, is a non-profit organization operating a dedicated, worldwide, Internet-based flight-simulation network. Users can connect to the network to either fly online as a pilot using flight simulation software such as FSX, Prepar3D or X-Plane, or direct traffic as an air traffic controller and participate in what has been described as a close approximation of real-life aviation procedures.</p>
