	<h1 class="mb-3">About MultiCrew</h1>

	<h4>What is MultiCrew?</h4>
	<p>MultiCrew is a community-driven flight simulation organisation that provides training and support for shared cockpit aircraft addons. We are a community-driven, non-profit organisation, which specialises in shared cockpit flying, training and support.</p>

	<h4>Who runs it?</h4>
	<p>The main Administrators who drive the projects and development along are two students from Scotland. You can see our full staff lineup on our <a href="staff.php">Staff page</a>. All our staff are volunteers!</p>

	<h4>When did it start?</h4>
	<p>MultiCrew was started in early 2017 and has been expanding ever since.</p>

	<h4>What does MultiCrew actually do?</h4>
	<p>We provide services to the flight simulation community. These include both informal training and pilot ratings for traffic networks, unofficial support, and means to organise shared cockpit flights.</p>

	<h4>What's in development?</h4>
	<p>We're developing many more web-based systems, courses and packages to help encourage participation in shared cockpit, and to help the community as a whole. You can read more about the recent developments on our <a href="../blog">Dev Blog</a>!</p>

	<h1 class="mb-3">Mission Statement</h1>

	<h4>What is MultiCrew's goal?</h4>
	<p>Our main goal is to increase participation and skill levels in shared cockpit flying in consumer and commercial flight simulators. Basically, that means we want you to fly more in shared cockpit setups!</p>

	<h4>How will MultiCrew achieve its goal?</h4>
	<p>Simply, by providing means to fly and train flight simmers in good-quality (usually payware), accurate and in-depth addons for the ESP flight simulators (FSX and P3D) which support high-fidelity shared cockpit flights.

	<h4>Can I help?</h4>
	<p>Of course! We're always looking for people to help us with our projects. Just send an email to <a href="mailto:&#097;&#100;&#109;&#105;&#110;&#064;&#109;&#117;&#108;&#116;&#105;&#099;&#114;&#101;&#119;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#046;&#117;&#107;">&#097;&#100;&#109;&#105;&#110;&#064;&#109;&#117;&#108;&#116;&#105;&#099;&#114;&#101;&#119;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#046;&#117;&#107;</a>, telling us how you'd like to help and what skills you have to offer.</p>
