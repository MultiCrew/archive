Dear {full name},

A Training Manager has updated your certifications. This could be because you've passed or failed an examination, or you've completed a pilot rating.

Please visit My Stats in myAcademy to view your updated certifications.

If you would like to discuss this any further, please forward this email to admin@multicrew.co.uk.

If you do not have any further sessions scheduled, please ensure you have up to date availability set in your myAcademy system.
